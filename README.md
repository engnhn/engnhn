## Hey there! 👋

I'm Engin Han, a developer who writes code, drinks tea, breaks things (occasionally on purpose), and learns something new in the process.

This profile isn't a portfolio of perfection it's more like a messy desk full of half-finished ideas, experiments gone wrong (or surprisingly right), and notes to my future self. I enjoy building things that work. I enjoy breaking them to understand *why* they work. Somewhere in between, I write code, refactor it, and occasionally refactor the refactor.

I tend to favor boring solutions that survive production over clever ones that don’t. Most of my decisions are shaped by trade-offs, failure modes, and what happens after launch. Production has a way of teaching humility.
