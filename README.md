## Hey there! 👋

I'm paleomnesis — a developer who writes code, drinks tea, breaks things (occasionally on purpose), and learns something new in the process.

This profile isn't a portfolio of perfection — it's more like a messy desk full of half-finished ideas, experiments gone wrong (or surprisingly right), and notes to my future self.

I enjoy building things that work. I enjoy breaking them to understand *why* they work. Somewhere in between, I write code, refactor it, and occasionally refactor the refactor. 

> Tea fuels the code. Coffee sometimes makes a cameo. But let’s be honest, tea is the real MVP. 🍵
